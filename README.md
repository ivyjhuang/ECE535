# ECE535
How our team is suitable:  
Alice took AI class  
Both of us did ML workshop with a staff member at M5  
Interested in getting a better understanding of ML   
We both learned a little about ML in Security Engineering ECE 371  

Motivation:  
To understand how federated learning works on multimodal sensory data. We are interested in federated learning, where the training is distributed across multiple devices instead of the traditional ML where training takes place in only one device. This project will help us get more comfortable with ML. 

Design Goals:
Understand the Federated Learning code and add our explanation for it on our GitHub repository  
Add comments to the code so anyone looking at the Federated Learning code for the first time can understand it  

Deliverables:  
Understand multimodal federated learning (code:https://github.com/yuchenzhao/iotdi22-mmfl)   
Use given datasets to reproduce the results in the paper â€¢ data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rWJYkfMavGs1F-H0jykJ5V0fIiwrQdJV   
Perform a per-class accuracy analysis of the results and observe the effect of skewed data distribution on the per-class accuracy   
Evaluate the system on a multimodal dataset that is relatively balanced in class distribution  

System blocks:

HW/SW requirements:  
There are no hardware requirements, only software requirements. The code and data set is provided in the Github repository. We will be testing and getting results with the Python code provided. 


Team members responsibilities:  
Setup - Alice and Ivy  
Software - Alice and Ivy  
Networking - Alice  
Writing - Ivy  
Research - Alice  
Algorithm Design - Ivy   

Project timeline:  
Familiarize ourselves with the code and get the setup done by Oct. 5  
Work about 1- 5 hrs/week  
Finish a week before the due date
